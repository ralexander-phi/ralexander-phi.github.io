# A simple website

This is a basic place for me to dump some static content.

[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is great way to host a site.
I don't really need a fancy <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> generator or similar.

I'm going for a minimalist theme.

## Run Locally

    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
